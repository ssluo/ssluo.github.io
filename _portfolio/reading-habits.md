**3/14/2020**: Started self-quarantining due to COVID-19  
**3/15/2020**: Read a whole book start to finish  
**3/16/2020**: Reorganized my book tracking spreadsheet  
**3/17/2020**: Made charts about my reading habits   

I've accumulated a few dozen rows of data about books I've read over the past two-ish years. To ring in a productive self-quarantine, I decided to get a better understanding of my reading habits and use those insights to set goals for this year's book consumption.

## Books per Year

Having an excess of time on my hands, I used my Kindle download history to make assumptions about the completion date for each book. I also used online word count estimators to guess the total words for each book. 

Using this data, I was able to plot the cumulative words read and books read for each year. 2018 was a particularly good year, reading-wise--I read a little under two books a week for the entire second half of the year. I was interning in NYC during that time, and had over an hour of commute every day to read.

2019 was less productive--I read eleven books total. However, it was still a decent chunk of words thanks to the massive ASOIAF series. Those books make up the large steps on the wordcount graph near day 150.

## Favorite Genres

Counting total books read by their primary genre yielded no surprises: I really enjoy sci-fi/fantasy. The group of fantasy/sci-fi/sci-fantasy makes up 58% of total books read since I started tracking this 2 years ago.

## Favorite Authors

Similarly unsurprising was my graph of top authors. I've been a China Mi√©ville fan for over a decade, and binged a good amount of his works in 2018. The other top authors *all* fall into the same sci-fi/fantasy group.

## Reading Goals

I used these insights to come up with some personal reading goals for the remaining 9 months of 2020:

- Read at least 12 books this year
	- Definitely achievable given my past reading pace. With 2 books down at time of writing, I only have 10 more books to go!
- Become a more balanced reader by: 
	- Reading books in at least four new genres
	- Having less than half of books read this year be sci-fi/fantasy
- Read books by authors outside of my favored set
	- This should be pretty straightforward if I manage the goal of reading in new genres. So, I'll make a more detailed goal: find an author I enjoy in a new genre and reading at least two books by that author.

Time to head to the (ebook) library!
