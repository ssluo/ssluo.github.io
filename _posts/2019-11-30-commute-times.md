Co-oping at the MBTA reshaped how I think about transportation - especially my morning commute. A week in, I started to track my commute by recording when every distinct stage started. This gave me a good idea of how long my commute took on average, and a more accurate number for the length of my Alewife-Park Street trip. (56 and 21 min respecively, in July/August 2019. Commute times likely to change post-September, with the start of the school year and cold weather.)

In retrospect, I should have been more thourough in my data collection - taking down morning weather and temperature would allow me to quantify the effect of weather on traffic levels, as well as my personal commute preferences (driving vs biking to the subway station).
